# `set bell-style visible` doesn't do much in Terminal, seems to disable
# audible and visual bell? Better option is to configure Terminal directly:
#  Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > Advanced
#    • disable "Audible bell"
#    • enable "Visual bell" (probably is enabled by default)
#    • disable "Only when sound is muted"

# Perform filename <Tab> completion in a case-insensitive fashion
set completion-ignore-case on

# Display all possible matches for an ambiguous pattern at the first <Tab> press
# instead of at the second
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# When symlink points to a directory treat like a directory during <Tab> completion
# (rather than require second <Tab> to add trailing slash and "enter" the directory)
set mark-symlinked-directories on
